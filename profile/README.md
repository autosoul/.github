## Goal

We are striving to create a **Non-Player Character Race** which are artificially sentient, hence Project NPCR.

We are working on changing the way NPCs interact with their environment by enriching their interpretation of data. In doing so, they will view the world in almost the same ways we do, and act accordingly to achieve goals they set for themselves.

We want to do this because we envision the future where we can emotionally connect with fictional characters by interacting with them in any preferred environment. We believe what we do is key to getting there.

## Team
Our team is currently looking for more technical people to work on this. If you share the same goals with us and wish to work with us, please contact 19whalehole@gmail.com.

## Funds
This is a self-funded project, we are not affiliated with any organization. We appreciate any amount of support given to us.
